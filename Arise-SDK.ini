; MinimumNPCDistance: how far away NPCs can be before they start to despawn/fade-out
; Game default is pretty low, something between 2500-4000, resulting in NPCs disappearing as soon as you turn a corner...
; It should be safe to set this to a high number, Arise-SDK default is 50000
; If Arise-SDK seems to give you a perf hit maybe try lowering this in steps of 1/2
MinimumNPCDistance = 50000

; Override*SharpenFilterStrength - allows overriding the two sharpen filters the game applies
; if set to -1 will leave the filter strength alone
; (game defaults: 0.5, 1)
OverrideCharaSharpenFilterStrength = -1
OverrideStageSharpenFilterStrength = -1

; MinStageEdgeBaseDistance - if the same tries setting a StageEdgeBaseDistance smaller than this, will force it to this instead
seems to be used for edge-detection/cel-shading, increasing this can allow further distances to be cel-shaded, likely at a performance hit
; (game default = 6000)
MinStageEdgeBaseDistance = 12000

; SkipIntroLogos: skips over the intro logo screens, straight to the autosave dialog
SkipIntroLogos = true

; StopMaxCSMResolutionOverwrite: prevents game from overwriting the r.Shadow.MaxCSMResolution cvar
; normally game will always overwrite this in memory based on value inside GameUserSettings.ini, preventing you from changing this inside an INI
; enable this if you want to set it inside Engine.ini, this will stop game from overwriting your value
; (NOTE: THIS WILL STOP THE INGAME SHADOW SETTING FROM WORKING PROPERLY!)
StopMaxCSMResolutionOverwrite = false

; StopScreenPercentageOverwrite: prevents game from overwriting the r.ScreenPercentage cvar
; similar to the above, game will always overwrite in memory any value you set inside INI, with values taken from GameUserSettings.ini
; enable this if you want to set it inside Engine.ini, this will stop game from overwriting your value
; (NOTE: THIS WILL STOP THE INGAME RESOLUTION SCALE SETTING FROM WORKING PROPERLY!)
StopScreenPercentageOverwrite = false

; DisableCutsceneCA: forces chromatic aberration to be disabled during cutscenes
; (cutscenes set r.OverridePostProcessSettingsTO14 which forces CA to 0.3, this patches the code so that CA is set to 0.0 instead)
; to disable CA outside of cutscenes I'd recommend setting r.SceneColorFringeQuality to 0 in your Engine.ini file too
DisableCutsceneCA = false
