; MinimumNPCDistance: how far away NPCs can be before they start to despawn/fade-out
; Game default is pretty low, something between 2500-4000, resulting in NPCs disappearing as soon as you turn a corner...
; It should be safe to set this to a high number, Arise-SDK default is 50000
; If Arise-SDK seems to give you a perf hit maybe try lowering this in steps of 1/2
; (set this to -1 to disable the NPC distance changes)
MinimumNPCDistance = 50000

; Override*SharpenFilterStrength - allows overriding the two sharpen filters the game applies
; setting to 0 will disable the filter, -1 will leave the filter set to games default, anything else will force the filter to that value
; (can be controlled ingame via sdk.CharaSharpenFilterStrength & sdk.StageSharpenFilterStrength cvars)
; (game defaults: 0.5, 1, set this to -1 to leave it at game default)
OverrideCharaSharpenFilterStrength = -1
OverrideStageSharpenFilterStrength = -1

; MinStageEdgeBaseDistance - if the game tries setting a StageEdgeBaseDistance smaller than this, will force it to this instead
; seems to be used for edge-detection/cel-shading, increasing this can allow further distances to be cel-shaded, likely at a performance hit
; (can be controlled ingame via sdk.MinStageEdgeBaseDistance cvar)
; (game default = 6000)
MinStageEdgeBaseDistance = 12000

; CutsceneRenderFix - scales up UTextureRenderTarget2D to match your screen resolution
; should help improve skit/cutscene resolution, but might apply to other things too if they use UTextureRenderTarget2D...
; if you notice any weirdness please let me know!
; (can be controlled ingame via sdk.CutsceneRenderFix cvar)
CutsceneRenderFix = true

; CutsceneRenderFix_EnableScreenPercentage - whether to scale screen res by r.ScreenPercentage cvar when scaling UTextureRenderTarget2D
; in certain cases the chosen screen percentage could mess up the aspect ratio of the RT, which seems to break camera position of it...
; if you use r.ScreenPercentage and cutscenes seem kinda bugged, try disabling this
; (can be controlled ingame via sdk.CutsceneRenderFixScreenPercentage cvar)
CutsceneRenderFix_EnableScreenPercentage = true

; OverrideTAAJitterScale - how much jitter to apply to edges used by TAA
; game default has this disabled (scale = 0), not sure if this can actually be beneficial or not
; (can be controlled ingame via sdk.TAAJitterScale cvar)
; (game default = 0, set this to -1 to leave it at game default)
OverrideTAAJitterScale = -1

; OverrideTAASharpness - overrides sharpen filter applied to TAA
; doesn't seem to make a huge difference though, but you can try tweaking it if you like
; (can be controlled ingame via sdk.TAASharpness cvar)
; (game default = 0.6, set this to -1 to leave it at game default)
OverrideTAASharpness = -1

; SkipIntroLogos: skips over the intro logo screens, straight to the autosave dialog
SkipIntroLogos = true

; StopMaxCSMResolutionOverwrite: prevents game from overwriting the r.Shadow.MaxCSMResolution cvar
; normally game will always overwrite this in memory based on value inside GameUserSettings.ini, preventing you from changing this inside an INI
; enable this if you want to set it inside Engine.ini, this will stop game from overwriting your value
; (NOTE: THIS WILL STOP THE INGAME SHADOW SETTING FROM WORKING PROPERLY!)
StopMaxCSMResolutionOverwrite = false

; StopScreenPercentageOverwrite: prevents game from overwriting the r.ScreenPercentage cvar
; similar to the above, game will always overwrite in memory any value you set inside INI, with values taken from GameUserSettings.ini
; enable this if you want to set it inside Engine.ini, this will stop game from overwriting your value
; (NOTE: THIS WILL STOP THE INGAME RESOLUTION SCALE SETTING FROM WORKING PROPERLY!)
StopScreenPercentageOverwrite = false

; DisableCutsceneCA: forces chromatic aberration to be disabled during cutscenes
; (cutscenes set r.OverridePostProcessSettingsTO14 which forces CA to 0.3, this patches the code so that CA is set to 0.0 instead)
; to disable CA outside of cutscenes I'd recommend setting r.SceneColorFringeQuality to 0 in your Engine.ini file too
; (can be controlled ingame via sdk.DisableCutsceneCA cvar)
DisableCutsceneCA = false
