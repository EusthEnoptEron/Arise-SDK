; MinimumNPCDistance: how far away NPCs can be before they start to despawn/fade-out
; Game default is pretty low, something between 2500-4000, resulting in NPCs disappearing as soon as you turn a corner...
; It should be safe to set this to a high number, Arise-SDK default is 100000
; If Arise-SDK seems to give you a perf hit maybe try lowering this in steps of 1/2
MinimumNPCDistance = 100000

; SkipIntroLogos: skips over the intro logo screens, straight to the autosave dialog

; StopMaxCSMResolutionOverwrite: prevents game from overwriting the r.Shadow.MaxCSMResolution cvar
; normally game will always overwrite this based on value inside GameUserSettings.ini, preventing you from changing this inside an INI
; enable this if you want to set it inside Engine.ini, this will stop game from overwriting your value
; (NOTE: THIS WILL STOP THE INGAME SHADOW SETTING FROM WORKING PROPERLY!)
StopMaxCSMResolutionOverwrite = false

; StopScreenPercentageOverwrite: prevents game from overwriting the r.ScreenPercentage cvar
; similar to the above, game will always overwrite any value you set inside INI, with values taken from GameUserSettings.ini
; enable this if you want to set it inside Engine.ini, this will stop game from overwriting your value
; (NOTE: THIS WILL STOP THE INGAME RESOLUTION SCALE SETTING FROM WORKING PROPERLY!)
