# Arise-SDK

(eventually) An XInput/DXGI wrapper DLL for poking around at Tales of Arise internals.

SDK generated with the ever useful [Unreal Finder Tool](https://github.com/CorrM/Unreal-Finder-Tool)

(UFT requires just 2 small code changes to work: ObjectsStore.cpp line 85, change to `GInfo.IsPointerNextToPointer = false;`, and NamesStore.cpp line 30, change to `for (int i = 0; i < 60; ++i)`)

Though I'm not sure how complete the SDK generated by UFT is (sadly development on it ended a while ago), hopefully it's generated enough to be useful.

# TODO:
- The actual wrapper stuff
- Console unlocking / loose-file loading (DQXIS-SDK contains these feature, should be possible to port over here)
- NPC draw-distance improvement
- Arise-specific CVar list (eg `Arise.PF.NPC.AllowDistanceDespawn`, `Arise.PF.Culling.Enable`...)
- MainThread hook for safer UObject accesses
