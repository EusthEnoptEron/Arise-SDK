# Arise-SDK

An XInput/DXGI wrapper DLL for poking around at Tales of Arise internals.

SDK generated with the ever useful [Unreal Finder Tool](https://github.com/CorrM/Unreal-Finder-Tool)

Though I'm not sure how complete the SDK generated by UFT is (sadly development on it ended a while ago), hopefully it's generated enough to be useful.

# TODO:
- Console unlocking / loose-file loading (I added these to [DQXIS-SDK](https://github.com/emoose/DQXIS-SDK) a while back, should be possible to port over here)
- Improve the NPC-draw-distance modifying code (atm it's hooking the code that checks the distances, ran nearly every frame... would be better to hook the part that actually loaded in those values, so we'd only need to modify it 1 time once it's been loaded)
- Arise-specific CVar list (eg `Arise.PF.NPC.AllowDistanceDespawn`, `Arise.PF.Culling.Enable`...)
- MainThread hook for safer UObject accesses
- Language changer - game seems to set language depending on system locale in certain cases, would be nicer if users can specify it instead

# UnrealFinderTool changes
Two small changes are needed for UFT to work properly with Arise:
- ObjectsStore.cpp line 85, change to `GInfo.IsPointerNextToPointer = false;` - fixes objects not being read in correctly
- NamesStore.cpp line 30, change to `for (int i = 0; i < 60; ++i)` - allows all UE FNames to be read in (previously would only read 30 chunks worth, resulting in SDK missing a ton of fields/properties)
