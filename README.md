# Arise-SDK

An XInput/DXGI wrapper DLL for poking around at Tales of Arise internals.

SDK generated with the ever useful [Unreal Finder Tool](https://github.com/CorrM/Unreal-Finder-Tool)

Though I'm not sure how complete the SDK generated by UFT is (sadly development on it ended a while ago), hopefully it's generated enough to be useful.

# Features
- A proof-of-concept NPC draw distance modifier, should allow NPCs to stay visible for much further, hopefully without issues!
- Dev-console will now also be unlocked automatically, so manually injecting other tools isn't required.
- Adds support for loading in loose, unpacked files without needing to pak them first (should be most useful for modders testing out their changes!)
- Skips the launch intro logos automatically
- [4000+ files](https://github.com/emoose/Arise-SDK/tree/master/SDK) relating to the games internals!

# TODO
- Arise-specific CVar list (eg `Arise.PF.NPC.AllowDistanceDespawn`, `Arise.PF.Culling.Enable`...)
- MainThread hook for safer UObject accesses
- Language changer - game seems to set language depending on system locale in certain cases, would be nicer if users can specify it instead

# UnrealFinderTool changes
Two small changes were needed for UFT to work properly with Arise:
- ObjectsStore.cpp line 85, change to `GInfo.IsPointerNextToPointer = false;` - fixes objects not being read in correctly
- NamesStore.cpp line 30, change to `for (int i = 0; i < 60; ++i)` - allows all UE FNames to be read in (previously would only read 30 chunks worth, resulting in SDK missing a ton of fields/properties)
